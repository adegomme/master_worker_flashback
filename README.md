## Master Worker Flashback

**Objective**: Compare the simulation time and memory footprint of the classical master-worker example provided in SimGrid distribution between different versions (currently 3.14 vs. 3.34)

**Requirements**:
  - Docker
  - Python3 and matplotlib

**Instructions**: just type `make`, which will:
  - build Docker images locally;
  - build the two versions of the simulators using these images; and
  - run a set of experiments that produce a result figure in pdf.
